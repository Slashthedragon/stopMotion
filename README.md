stopMotion
==========

This is a stop motion prgram from Alex at the MaineHackerClub. It was written for Maine Discovery Museum.

The History
===========

The program is used in a kiosh. There are 3 buttons on the kiosh. The original buttons were start, capture, and playback. These buttons went to a happcontrol board which went to a usb port. The computer was a windows 98(?) and was 11 years old.  The mouse buttons, left, center, and right, acted the same as the kiosh buttons. A replacement board would have 
arround $150. 

Because there is a limited budget, $0, the volunteers at Maine Hacker Club donated salvaged equipment and their time. The old CRT was replaced with a vga LED panel. The buttons circuit board is a modified keyboard and modified mouse. The camera was a close circuit camera and is now a salvaged web cam donated by Derrick S.

My, Denis S, original idea was to use a stopmotion program for Ubuntu called Stopmotion.  Eric L. thought that ImageMagic was the way to go and wrote a script for that. Because I had no expeerience with ImageMagic and I was more formilliar with how children behave at museums I knew there was a lot of work to be done.  

When demonstating what I wanted to do at a hacker meeting using Ubuntu Stopmotion, Jason M contributed to my understanding about the software programing. Alex G. commented that the Stopmotion is much more complete we need and that he could write a C++ program using openFrameworks.  This became the start. 

Alex G loaded the software onto my computer but it would need to be loaded onto a computer that could remain at the museum until it died. I took the program and taught myself C++ practically from scratch. I don't mean to say the others did not help my education, it was a constant how do I do this or that.

Eric L had made the keyboard switch adapter. This worked great but because I was doing so much testing and the program was using the keyboard I decided to use the mouse which I could hold in my hand while testing. Both Eric and Alex think that the keyboard is the better method. It may be because of the TODO: list.

TODO: Save file
===============
We would like to allow the program to save the video to the web.  This would be done using a coin box with a switch that would send it to the cloud. Alex helped me set up awsamazon. Alex and I met at the IMRC at the University of Maine and had things working on the computer donated by Eric. With his help I was able to enter the final code to upload to the cloud with a push of the button.

Set Back
========

When I took it to the museum the computer started to misbehave. Eric and I met to do troubleshooting. I had some damaged laptops with me. Eric later found that the computer which misbehaved had bad ram. I revived a laptop by replacing the broken screen with one which Eric had salvaged.

Finially
========

I loaded the software onto the restored laptop and was able to install it at the museum.  The buttons are Capture, Delete Last, and Playback.  Save uses the "p" or "x" keys on keyboard in under the desk. The images and movies get saved with a date time tag. They are save on the computer and maybe to awsamazon if the code is correct.
